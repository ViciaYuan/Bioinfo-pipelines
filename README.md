# Bioinfo-pipelines

There are three main parts of this repo:
* __bioinfo_raining__: Notes& summary of computational biology training course (for third-year undergrates) 
* __cpg_analysis__: Pipeline notes on chloroplast genome analysis (with a focus on assembly for now )
* __RNA_seq__: RNA-sequencing based analysis notes (still in preparation)
